# Higher-Order Program Verification Problems

These benchmarks were generated by [r_type][rtype] and encode correctness of functional programs, most of them higher-order. All problems are encoded in the SMT-LIB 2 `Horn` logic, and start with a `set-info` containing the program they come from.

See also the [original repository][benchs].
